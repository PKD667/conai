Typed Lambda Calculus Grammar: Lexical elements include `λ`/`\`/`lambda`, `->`, `()`, `:`, `.`, and identifiers. Type syntax follows `Type ::= BaseType [-> Type]` and `BaseType ::= ID | (Type)` with right-associative function types. Expressions are defined as `Expr ::= Abstraction | Application` where `Abstraction ::= λ ID:Type.Expr` creates functions and `Application ::= Atom {Atom}` applies them (left-associative). Atomic expressions (`Atom ::= ID | (Expr)`) are either identifiers or parenthesized expressions. Functions follow the standard syntax `λx:T.e` where x is a variable of type T and e is the body, while applications like `f x y` are parsed as `(f x) y` by default.
